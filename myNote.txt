component in Angular
for creating a component you need to named it like:
courses.component.ts
name-of-app.component.ts


Module:
in your model you need to add the component
after you added component it will automatically will import


in angular we can have a custome html element
it means that instead of html we can add new things


crating a component from cli:
ng generate component appName
=> ng g c course
the good news is that it will automatically register as well

`backtick`
the beauty of backtick is that you can extend your template 

generatin a service in angular cli
ng generate service name-of-service
ng g s Email

ng:
Directives: 
stractural: Modify the stracture of a DOM 
Attribute: Modify the attriibue of the DOM

ngif vs hidden property:
if we use if then the next statement will remove form the dom but if you use 
hidden still we have that element as well so which one we should choose?

if you are working with a large trees it's better to use '**ngif' because it will
help you to not consume to much resources

but if it's small tree it dosen't matter which one you chose


ngSwitch:
is for swiching

ngFor
